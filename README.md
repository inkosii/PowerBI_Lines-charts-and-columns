# PowerBI_Lines-charts-and-columns

I have been learning about Business Intelligence (BI) with a focus on Finance, Sales, HR, and Marketing reports. As part of my learning, I have worked with various visualizations, including line charts, tree maps, column charts, and more, using datasets to enhance my skills in KPI analysis and data-driven decision-making.

## ⚠️ Important: Dataset Not Included  
This Power BI (`.pbix`) file contains visualizations and analysis, but **it does not include the dataset**.  

### How to Use This File  
- The original dataset is stored **locally** and was not uploaded due to licensing restrictions.  
- To view the full report, you must **reconnect to your own dataset**.  
- If using a different dataset, update the **data source settings** in Power BI:  
  1. Open the `.pbix` file in **Power BI Desktop**.  
  2. Navigate to **Transform Data → Data Source Settings**.  
  3. Click **Change Source** and select your dataset.  
  4. Apply changes and refresh the report.
